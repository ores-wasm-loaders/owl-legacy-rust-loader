# owl-rust-loader — agent notes

This repository is the shared Rust/Wasm adapter family: one wasm-bindgen lifecycle wrapper plus Leptos (`hydrate_islands`) and Dioxus (route-chunk) hooks, so 80–90% of the fleet's Rust web apps load through one code path.

- The generated `wasm-bindgen` glue of a release is part of that release and is never swapped between apps: this package wraps the lifecycle, it does not replace the glue.
- Leptos islands hydrate islands, not the whole app; an island is not automatically its own bundle — only the emitted build graph decides that.
- Dioxus route chunks are loaded through the framework's own splitting, never a competing splitter.
- Never React/JSX and never a webview. TypeScript, Rust and Dart are modularized (nothing
  lives only in `main.*`); favor pure functions, explicit inputs and outputs, immutability,
  typed errors, exhaustive matching, and effects pushed to the edges.
- No third-party runtime dependencies in this org. The loading layer is the first thing a
  page runs; it must not drag a dependency tree in front of itself.
- Contracts are TypeSpec + JSON Schema peers checked by ORESoftware/ores-contracts; the
  shared vocabulary comes from `ores-wasm-loaders/owl-interfaces` through zed-pkg.
- Preparation and activation are different operations and must stay that way: preparation
  never executes application code, authenticates, subscribes, or writes.
- Resolve git conflicts semantically (reconcile both sides; never just pick one); never
  rebase, stash, or reset. `main` is production, `dev` is integration.

## Canonical agent instructions

Before doing anything else in this repository, also read:

    .ores/agents/AGENTS.md

That path is a symlink to `~/codes/oresoftware/my-ai/AGENTS.md`, whose canonical copy is
<https://github.com/ORESoftware/my-ai/blob/main/AGENTS.md>. The symlink is deliberately not
committed (it names an absolute path only valid on a machine with that checkout), so `.ores/`
is git-ignored. If it is missing on your machine:

    mkdir -p .ores/agents
    ln -sfn "$HOME/codes/oresoftware/my-ai/AGENTS.md" .ores/agents/AGENTS.md

A missing `.ores/agents/AGENTS.md` is a setup gap on the reader's machine, never a reason to
skip the canonical instructions: fetch them from the URL above instead.
